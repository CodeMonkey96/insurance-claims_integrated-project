# Project Identification: Boosting Insurance Inclusion in Africa

## Project Introduction
The insurance industry in Africa presents a vast potential for growth, yet faces a significant challenge: low insurance penetration. Despite a large population (17% of the world's total) and growing economies, insurance uptake remains limited. This project aims to address this critical gap.

## Defining a Problem Statement
**Problem:**  Across Africa, a complex interplay of factors restricts individuals and businesses from adopting insurance.

- **High Affordability Barrier:** Traditional insurance premiums can be a significant burden, often exceeding disposable income.
- **Limited Insurance Knowledge:** Many lack understanding of the benefits of insurance and its role in mitigating risks.
- **Inefficient Targeting:** Current marketing strategies might not be reaching the demographics with the greatest need and potential for specific insurance products.
- **Consequences:**  Low insurance penetration hinders financial security and economic resilience.  Individuals and businesses remain vulnerable to financial setbacks caused by unforeseen events.

**Desired Outcome:**  Increase insurance policy adoption across Africa, fostering a culture of financial preparedness and promoting economic stability.
